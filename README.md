# Docker-Microservices-Nameko

## Nameko

- [Nameko is a framework for building microservices in Python.](https://nameko.readthedocs.io/en/stable/what_is_nameko.html)
- Out of the box you can build a service that can respond to RPC messages, dispatch events on certain actions, and listen to events from other services. It could also have HTTP interfaces for clients that canâ€™t speak AMQP, and a websocket interface for, say, Javascript clients.
