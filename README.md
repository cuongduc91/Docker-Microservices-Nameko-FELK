# Docker-Microservices-Nameko

## REPO

### Services

- gateway: Exposing HTTP API to be used by external clients, Web or Mobile Apps

- products: create/store/manage product info and exposing Remote Procedure Call (RPC) API that can be consumed by other services. This service uses Redis as database.

- oders: create/store/manage oder info and also exposing RPC API which is consumed by other services.

## Nameko

- [Nameko](https://nameko.readthedocs.io/en/stable/what_is_nameko.html) is a framework for building microservices in Python.
- Out of the box you can build a service that can respond to RPC messages, dispatch events on certain actions, and listen to events from other services. It could also have HTTP interfaces for clients that canâ€™t speak AMQP, and a websocket interface for, say, Javascript clients.

## DBeaver

- Download and install [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io) as GUI configuration to the PostgresSQL database via port 5432

## Docker

- [Download and Install Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- Run the .yml file to build the containers as environment

```
docker-compose up

```

## CRUD

- Create Product

```sh
$ curl -XPOST -d '{"id": "product_1", "title": "Generator", "capacity": 1000, "maximum_speed": 5, "in_stock": 10}' 'http://localhost:8003/products'

```

- Read Product

```sh
$ curl 'http://localhost:8003/products/product_1'
```

- Create Order

```sh
$ curl -XPOST -d '{"order_details": [{"product_id": "product_1", "price": "100000.99", "quantity": 1}]}' 'http://localhost:8003/orders'

{"id": 1}
```

- Read Order

```sh
$ curl 'http://localhost:8003/orders/1'
```

## Testing

Ensure RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL and Redis are running and `config.yaml` files for each service are configured correctly.

```
$ make coverage
```

## FELK

- FELK stands for Filebeat,Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

### Filebeat

- In the file filebeat.yml, there are codes for reading .log files and instant docker inputs
- The docker inputs are live-running containers except running ELK containers since they have been supported by Kibana
- The filebeat.autodiscover mode can identify all running containers
  Ports used for config. :

* 5044: Logstash
* 9200: Elasticsearch
* 5601: Kibana

### Kibana

- Type the localhost:5061 in the browser to go as an entry point to Kibana interface.
- For default the id and password corresponding to "elastic" and "password".
- Remember to change reload in Kibana from default "last 15 minutes" to "Year to date" to observe the whole example .log data
